<p><strong>Actor:</strong> A Data Curator wants to upload a dataset to the registry &ndash;
this will likely involve a pre-processing step to convert a &lsquo;raw
dataset&rsquo; into a suitable &lsquo;processed dataset&rsquo; that can be used by a
model. Has knowledge of system and required config files to produce an
upload script</p>
<p><strong>Preconditions</strong>: Actor has an account (if required) to access data
registry and a local copy of the dataset they want to upload (QUESTION:
what formats are acceptable?)</p>
<p><strong>Basic Flow:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Actor generates metadata file for dataset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actor generates a config file that gives name and location for data,
metadata, desired name on registry</p>

<li>

<li>
<p>Do we want an Actor to confirm here that they have permission to
upload/share the data?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actor logs into system, system authenticates (Question: or should
this be part of the config file?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(optionally) Actor runs processing script to turn a dataset into the
data format required</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actor runs upload script, system responds and ingests data and
metadata</p>
<ul>
<li>Included in system response: system compares to existing data
(possible exception case: user tries to upload dataset already
in the registry)</li>

<li>
<p>System prompts Actor to confirm they have permission to upload/share
these data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System prompts user for metadata, with form or upload option</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actor either uploads metadata file (Question: in what format?), or
enters information in form</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System records metadata with dataset, creates data product and adds

<li>
<p>Where / how? Could happen in Django... already thought about doing
this in a shiny app, should it generate a script that can be

  Use Case 5. Parameter inference coupled with model simulation

<p>This requires repeated application of <strong>two component use cases</strong> shown
below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use case: <strong>draw multiple data from data pipeline/registry</strong> for use
in analysis (data for inference)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use case: <strong>Run model/analysis that generates multiple

</ol>
<p>Actor: Researcher undertaking significant inference or analysis exercise
couple with model simulation where repeated sampling and recording is
required</p>
<p>Benefit: really useful as a way of archiving derivatives of complex
queries, potentially linking otherwise separate datasets and generating
multiple iterations. Careful nomenclature of such files, as well as
stoarge capacity seem very important considerations</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really have a way of doing write-then-read at the moment -
would this be a good reason to adopt local SQLite (or
other) registry?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we think about multiple runs with potentially thousands of
outputs and encapsulate them in a single larger-scale output? Would
RO Crate help here?</p>

<p>Subsequent revisions to the inference algorithm (step-2), data used for
inference (step-1) or additional data used for simulation (step-3) would
then flag subsequent model outputs as needing revision. If outputs from
step-4 are used in further analysis want to track dependencies i.e. if
the data or analysis in any step is flagged I want to see this when I
look at downstream outputs.</p>
<p>This requires application of four further <strong>component use cases</strong> shown
below:</p>
<ol>

<p>Actor: Data/code producer (5 &amp; 6). Data/software user (7 &amp; 8)</p>
<p>Benefit: Results are linked to any known issues with their dependencies,
and potential users are aware of any known issues</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are models/analysis in the data pipeline/registry? - Yes, linked to
particular Github hashes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we implement tracing flagged items through the dependency
links and alerting users of them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are problems flagged / quality assessments recorded? Issues can
be attached to any object in the registry (data products, software
releases, ...). Can also have active quality assessments recorded
(eg scorecards completed, data quality assessments) but should not
rely on that being done for every object in the chain.</p>

<p><strong>Actor:</strong> Policy broker who has an output, previously generated and

output has been superseded, and if so, in what ways. Or modeller has an
analysis that they have previously done, wants to know if they ran it
again are any of the data products or model code updated?</p>
<p><strong>Preconditions</strong>: Actor has an account (if required) to access data
registry.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Flow:</strong></p>

</h1>
<p><strong>Actor:</strong> Policy broker who has a query about the provenance of an
output, previously generated and registered within the pipeline. There
is a need to confirm whether the output had appropriate caveats attached
when circulated. (Sorry to be negative, but I can see this happening&hellip;
)</p>
<p><strong>Preconditions</strong>: Actor has an account (if required) to access data
registry.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Flow:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Actor accesses registry entry for the specified output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actor queries registry to recover the status of the data resources
used at the time the output was generated (I assume these latter are
available from the metadata of the output itself; if these are not
available, is there sufficient information in the metadata for them
to be reconstructed?)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Postconditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No change to registry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actor has sufficient information to assess the output from the point
of view of the needs of policy customers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exception cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The obvious one is the situation where the output has not been
registered in the registry, but where there is sufficient knowledge
of the data resources used to be confident about what was actually
used. However, I think we should not seek to cover this scenario,
since the users have already broken the system, and the existence of
a tool to retrospectively cover everyone&rsquo;s back might just encourage
poor behaviour..</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions: How would we keep track of history of status/issues to be
able to re-create status reports from past points in time? If status
consists of timestamped issues and QA reports that are then immutable,
then this would be possible.</p>
<p>How important is it that this is easy / convenient vs &ldquo;possible by
digging into the database&rdquo;?</p>

actor may not have access to report, or may only have document</p>
<p><strong>Actor:</strong> Member of public wants to understand provenance of reported
results</p>
<p><strong>Basic Flow:</strong></p>
<p>Possible ways this could work:</p>
<p>1. Via a searchable interface to the data registry</p>
<p>2. Have access to PDF (or other format) of policy document</p>
<ul>
<li>can use PDF directly to identify provenance report to display</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Have access to pdf of report and can use pdf to identify provenance
report to display</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PDF has embedded DOI or link to provenance report in registry</p>

<li>
<p>PDF is uploaded by user and the system identifies it via a checksum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PDF has a unique title/identifier used to look up provenance report</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Report documents must be (manually?) added to registry for
this to work. Or must be part of workflow for latex document creation.</p>

<p>Any user of the model outputs (e.g. modeller, policy maker) wants to
know what changed between two published model outputs / reports, and
generates a diff between the provenances</p>

<p>This requires use case 12, plus a mechanism for displaying a

<p>Possible ways this could work:</p>
<p>1. visualisation platform itself uses traceability framework within it

<p>2. visualisation platform manually links back to provenance of the

  <a class="anchor" href="#use-case-16-actor-wants-to-do-a-model-run-inside-a-safe-haven">#</a>
</h1>
<p><strong>Preconditions</strong>: Actor has an account (if required) to access data
registry, actor has access to safe haven, metadata is public</p>
<p><strong>Basic Flow:</strong></p>
<p>Possible ways this could work:</p>
<p>1. Registry sits inside safe haven, as does all data required for
analysis &ndash; full pipeline runs inside safe haven</p>
<ul>
<li>Registry must sync with an external registry (at simplest just a
read-only copy) or have a direct external public interface to ensure
public availability of provenance data, otherwise many use cases
will break &ndash; especially anything policy- or public-facing, where
users will not have access to safe haven</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Registry sits outside safe haven, public data can be hosted outside
safe haven, but is pulled in as required to be used in the modelling run
along with the private data. Pipeline run generates log files that are
then pushed back to registry after run.</p>
<p>Then as use case 4.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p>Potential issue with 1 &ndash; how does post-processing of results generated
in a safe haven (e.g. to produce reports) work if write access to
registry is only available inside safe haven?</p>

<p><strong>Preconditions</strong>: Actor has an account (if required) to access data
registry, metadata is public, actor has access to the private data which
is registered in registry</p>
<p><strong>Basic Flow:</strong></p>
<p>How this could work:</p>
<p>Local pipeline scripts have to know about local cache of private files,
then pipeline can execute as normal in use case 4.</p>

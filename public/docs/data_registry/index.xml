      <description>Local FAIR data registry # The documentation for the registry is available here, and is the same for the local and remote registry.
Installation # There are a few alternative ways to install a local FAIR data registry and we describe the different options below.
Dependencies # The registry relies on the graphviz package to produce the schema visualisation and the provenance report, so you will need to follow graphviz installation process for your system before initialising a local registry.</description>

      <description>The FAIR data registry schema has been designed to address the different requirements around the information needed on different research objects associated with an epidemiological pipeline.
Main entities # The main entities represented in the schema are around the data and the software for epidemiological models:
DataProduct: A dataset that is used by or is generated by a model. ExternalObject: An external data object, i.e. one that has comes from somewhere other than being generated as part of the modelling pipeline.</description>

      <title>Provenance Report</title>

      <description>Provenance Report # In order to address the use case around being able to track the evidence to understand the reported results, the data registry has the capability to produce provenance reports for each of the data products.
Provenance is the documented history of processes in a digital object&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle.
The provenance reports generated by the registry are based around the concepts of activities, agents and entities. For more information about these concepts see the PROV Ontology or PROV-O.</description>

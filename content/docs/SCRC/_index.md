# SCRC

## Who are we?

The Scottish COVID-19 Response Consortium is formed of [dozens of individuals from over 30 academic and commercial organisations](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/scrc/ourpeople/#members).

Researchers in these organisations jointly responded to a call by the [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/health-and-wellbeing/ramp/) to develop more epidemiological models of COVID-19 spread - [RAPID ASSISTANCE IN MODELLING THE PANDEMIC: RAMP](https://epcced.github.io/ramp/) - in order to develop a more robust and clearer understanding of the impacts of different exit strategies from lockdown. Scientists from several other organisations across the UK and abroad have now joined the consortium to provide additional expertise in specific areas.

## Our outputs:

See our [SCRC GitHub website](https://scottishcovidresponse.github.io) for an overview of our work beyond the data pipeline, and our [SCRC](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse) and [FAIRDataPipeline](https://github.com/FAIRDataPipeline) GitHub organisations for our specific outputs.

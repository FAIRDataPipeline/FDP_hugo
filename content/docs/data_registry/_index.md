# FAIR Data Registry

The FAIR data pipeline requires a data registry to effectively store meta-data and allow interoperability between the [modelling APIs]({{< relref "/docs/api/" >}}), as well as the [CLI]({{< relref "/docs/cli/" >}}).

There are two types of data registry:
- [The local registry]({{< relref "/docs/data_registry/local_registry/" >}})
- [The remote registry]({{< relref "/docs/data_registry/remote_registry/" >}})

The FAIR data registry schema has been designed to address the different requirements around the information needed on different research objects associated with an epidemiological pipeline.

## Main entities

The main entities represented in the schema are around the data and the software for epidemiological models:
- **DataProduct**: A dataset that is used by or is generated by a model.
- **ExternalObject**: An external data object, i.e. one that has comes from somewhere other than being generated as part of the modelling pipeline.
- **CodeRun**: A code run along with its associated, code repo, configuration, input and outputs.
- **CodeRepoRelease**: Information marking that an `Object` is an official release of a model code.
- **Object**: Core traceability object used to represent any FAIR data object such `DataProduct`, `CodeRepoRelease`, `CodeRun`. 
### Data representation

For the data representation, the schema also supports categorising datasets by using:
- **Namespace**: A namespace is a way to group `DataProduct`s following some specific categorisation criteria, such as what is the organisation producing the data product.

### Models representation

## FAIR research objects

The schema also represents FAIR objects, which are associated with **DataProduct**s, **CodeRun**s and so on.

The Object is associated with:
- **Licence**: Licence that can be associated with an `Object` in case the code or data source has a specific licence that needs to be recorded.
- **StorageLocation**: The location of an item relative to a `StorageRoot`.
- **StorageRoot**: The root location of a storage cache where model files are stored.
- **QualityControlled**: Marks that the associated `Object` has been quality controlled.
- **Keyword**: Keywords that can be associated with an `Object` usually for use with `ExternalObject`s to record paper keywords, and so on.

The object is also associated with entities related to users and authors:
- **Author**: Authors that can be associated with an `Object` usually for use with `ExternalObject`s to record paper authors, etc.
- **UserAuthor**: A combination of an `Author` associated with a particular user.

### Internal provenance

Finally, the schema also includes some entities that are used internally:
- **BaseModel**: Base model for all objects in the database. Used to defined common fields and functionality to keep internal provenance information such as when it was last updated and by whom.

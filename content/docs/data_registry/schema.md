The FAIR data registry schema has been designed to address the different requirements around the information needed on different research objects associated with an epidemiological pipeline.


The main entities represented in the schema are:
- **DataProduct**: A dataset that is used by or is generated by a model.
- **ExternalObject**: An external data object, i.e. one that has comes from somewhere other than being generated as part of the modelling pipeline.
- **CodeRun**: A code run along with its associated, code repo, configuration, input and outputs.

In addition, the following entities provide extra capabilities:
- **Namespace**: A namespace is a way to group `DataProduct`s following some specific categorisation criteria, such as what is the organisation producing the data product.
- **Licence**: Licence that can be associated with an `Object` in case the code or data source has a specific licence that needs to be recorded.
- **CodeRepoRelease**: Information marking that an `Object` is an official release of a model code.
- **StorageLocation**: The location of an item relative to a `StorageRoot`.
- **StorageRoot**: The root location of a storage cache where model files are stored.
- **QualityControlled**: Marks that the associated `Object` has been quality controlled.

Entities related to users and authors:
- **Author**
- **UserAuthor**

Finally, the schema also includes some entities that are used internally:
- **Object**: Core traceability object used to represent any data object such `DataProduct`, `CodeRepoRelease`, etc. 
- **BaseModel**: Base model for all objects in the database. Used to defined common fields and functionality to keep internal provenance information such as when it was last updated and by whom.

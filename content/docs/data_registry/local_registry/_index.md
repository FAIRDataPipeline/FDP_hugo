# Local Registry

The local registry is required to store metadata locally and can be installed using the [CLI]({{< relref "/docs/data_registry/local_registry/installation" >}}).

As well as storing metadata locally the local registry can be syncronised with the [remote registry]({{< relref "/docs/data_registry/remote_registry/" >}}) using the [CLI]({{< relref "/docs/cli/#fair-push" >}}).

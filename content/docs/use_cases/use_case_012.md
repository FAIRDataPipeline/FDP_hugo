Use Case 12. Actor wants to understand provenance of reported results
=====================================================================

Similar to use cases 9 or 10, but no preconditions about accounts, and
actor may not have access to report, or may only have document

**Actor:** Member of public wants to understand provenance of reported
results

**Basic Flow:**

Possible ways this could work:

1\. Via a searchable interface to the data registry

2\. Have access to PDF (or other format) of policy document

-   can use PDF directly to identify provenance report to display

2\. Have access to pdf of report and can use pdf to identify provenance
report to display

-   PDF has embedded DOI or link to provenance report in registry

-   PDF is uploaded by user and the system identifies it via a checksum

-   PDF has a unique title/identifier used to look up provenance report

**Notes:** Report documents must be (manually?) added to registry for
this to work. Or must be part of workflow for latex document creation.
